            <h2>Manny Pacquiao outside of boxing</h2>
            <p>He has done many more than these handful of accomplishments, but it's not the reason I care for him as a person. He does not flaunt around his money and instead gives away majority of what most would spend, and save what he spends in his pocket. I do not neccesarily know the guy personally, but he is said to be someone that knows how to conduct himself, with respect for himself and who he has around him. His accomlplishments are great, but his patience, and his passion for what he does, such as helping his country is what I about him. I truly hope to be something like him at some point in my life, or if possible, better. you can find out more about not inly his great career, but also what he has done for others <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao">here</a>.</p>
